Still
 

Admittedly I can be anxious at times
As I consider the challenges I have to face
Like when I work to get ahead
And still fall behind
I start to wonder if I was meant to win the race
Striving to do things right, but when things go wrong
Tempted to hide

But this time I will be still
This time I will be still

Thankfully it is hard for me
To keep feeling this way, when I consider
Who is on my side
(The Lord is My Help)
Walking with me every step I need to take
On the desperate days and the long dark nights
24-7 He never sleeps
And when I remember
It brings me peace

This time I will be still
This time I will be still

And the mountain has to move
The mountain must obey
The words that I speak
And bow down to my faith
Because I got work to do
And I'm gonna see it thru
God showed me the way
And I'm choosing it today

The mountain has to move
The mountain must obey
The words that I speak
And bow down to my faith
Because I got work to do
And I'm gonna see it thru
God showed me the way
And I'm choosing it today

This time I will be still
(This time no mountain can stop me)
This time I will be still
(This time I'm focused and resolute)
This time I will be still
(My help is coming, my help is here in you)
The Lord is my help
The Lord is my help
This time I will be still
And the mountain has to move
