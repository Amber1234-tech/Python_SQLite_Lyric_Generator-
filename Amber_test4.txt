Holy Water
 

[Verse 1]
God, I'm on my knees again
God, I'm begging please again
I need You
Oh, I need You
Walking down these desert roads
Water for my thirsty soul

Oh, I need You

Your forgiveness
Is like sweet, sweet honey on my lips
Like the sound of a symphony to my ears
Like holy water on my skin, hey!

Dead man walking, slave to sin
I wanna know about being born again
I need You
Oh, God, I need You
So, take me to the riverside
Take me under, baptize
I need You
Oh, God, I need You, oh-oh

[Chorus]
Your forgiveness
Is like sweet, sweet honey on my lips
Like the sound of a symphony to my ears
Like holy water on my skin
On my skin

[Bridge]
I don't wanna abuse Your grace
God, I need it every day
It's the only thing that ever really
Makes me wanna change
I don't wanna abuse Your grace
God, I need it every day

It's the only thing that ever really
Makes me wanna change
I don't wanna abuse Your grace
God, I need it every day
It's the only thing that ever really
Makes me wanna change, oh-oh-oh
I don't wanna abuse Your grace
God, I need it every day
It's the only thing that ever really
Makes me wanna change

Your forgiveness
Is like sweet, sweet honey on my lips
Like the sound of a symphony to my ears
It's like holy water
Your forgiveness

Oh, is like sweet, sweet honey on my lips
Like the sound of a symphony to my ears
Oh, it's like holy water on my skin
Yeah, it's like holy water on my skin
Oh, it's like holy water

Raise a Hallelujah
 

[Verse 1: Jonathan David Helser]
I raise a hallelujah in the presence of my enemies
I raise a hallelujah louder than the unbelief
I raise a hallelujah, my weapon is a melody
I raise a hallelujah, Heaven comes to fight for me

[Chorus: Melissa Helser]
I'm gonna sing in the middle of the storm
Louder and louder, you're gonna hear my praises roar
Up from the ashes, hope will arise
Death is defeated, the King is alive

[Verse 2: Jonathan David Helser]
I raise a hallelujah with everything inside of me
I raise a hallelujah, I will watch the darkness flee
I raise a hallelujah in the middle of the mystery
I raise a hallelujah, fear, you lost your hold on me

[Chorus: Jonathan David Helser & Melissa Helser]
I'm gonna sing in the middle of the storm
Louder and louder, you're gonna hear my praises roar
Up from the ashes, hope will arise
Death is defeated, the King is alive

[Bridge: Jonathan David Helser & Melissa Helser]
Sing a little louder (Sing a little louder)
Sing a little louder (Sing a little louder)
Sing a little louder (Sing a little louder)
Sing a little louder (Oh, sing a little louder)
Sing a little louder (In the presence of my enemies)
Sing a little louder (Louder than the unbelief)
Sing a little louder (My weapon is a melody)
Sing a little louder (Heaven comes to fight for me)
Sing a little louder

[Chorus: Melissa Helser & Jonathan David Helser]
I'm gonna sing in the middle of the storm
Louder and louder, you're gonna hear my praises roar
Up from the ashes, hope will arise
Death is defeated, the King is alive
I'm gonna sing in the middle of the storm
Louder and louder, you're gonna hear my praises roar
Up from the ashes, hope will arise
Death is defeated, the King is alive

[Outro: Jonathan David Helser & Melissa Helser]
I raise a hallelujah (Hallelujah)
I raise a hallelujah (I raise a hallelujah)
I raise a hallelujah (I raise a hallelujah)
I raise a hallelujah

Graves Into Gardens (Live)
 

[Verse 1]
I searched the world
But it couldn't fill me
Man's empty praise and treasures that fade are never enough
Then You came along
And put me back together
And every desire is now satisfied
Here in Your love (Hey)

[Chorus]
Oh, there's nothing better than You
There's nothing better than You
Lord, there's nothing
Nothing is better than You

[Interlude]
Oh, yes, I know it's true
Come on, stand up

[Verse 2]
I'm not afraid
To show You my weakness
My failures and flaws
Lord, You've seem them all
And You still call me friend
'Cause the God of the mountain
Is the God of the valley
There's not a place Your mercy and grace
Won't find me again

[Chorus]
Oh, there's nothing better than You
There's nothing (Oh) better than You
Lord, there's nothing
Nothing is better than You (I know it's true)
Oh, there's nothing better than You (Somebody testify)
There's nothing better than you (Oh, there's nothing, nothing, no)
Lord, there's nothing
Nothing is better than You

[Interlude]
Faith has made a way for you all so you can sing this
Come on, tear the roof off

[Bridge]
You turn mourning to dancing
You give beauty for ashes
You turn shame into glory
You're the only one who can (Come on)

You turn mourning to dancing
You give beauty for ashes
You turn shame into glory (Tell 'em now)
You're the only one who can (Let's turn the graves)
You turn graves into gardens
You turn bones into armies
You turn seas into highways
You're the only one who can (He's the only Lord)
You're the only one who can

[Chorus]
Oh, there's nothing (Come on, choir) better than You
There's nothing better than You
Lord, there's nothing
Nothing is better than You (Search and not found)
Oh, there's nothing better than You
There's nothing better than you (Oh, there's nothing)
Lord, there's nothing
Nothing is better than You

[Interlude]
Oh, come on, let's turn our graves into a garden, say:

[Bridge]
You turn graves into gardens
You turn bones into armies
You turn seas into highways
You're the only one who can (Turn to graves)
You turn graves into gardens (Turn your bones into an army)
You turn bones into armies (He's makin' waves through the seas)
You turn seas into highways
You're the only one who can
You're the only one who can (Praise to the Lord)
You're the only one who can
You're the only one who can

[Interlude]
Somebody give Him praise in this house
Woo
I don't think we're finished yet, come on
I think He's turning some things over tonight
You turn my mourning into dancing, come on:

[Bridge]
You turn mourning to dancing (Yeah)
You give beauty for ashes (Shame into glory)
You turn shame into glory (Say it, the only name)
You're the only one who can (Oh, He's turnin' my grave)
