Rock Of Ages
 

Rock of ages, cleft for me
Let me hide myself in Thee
Rock of ages, cleft for me
Let me hide myself in Thee

Let the water and the blood
From Thy riven side which flowed
Be of sin the double cure
Cleanse me from it's guilt and pow'r

Nothing in my hand I bring
Simply to Thy cross I cling
Nothing in my hand I bring

Simply to Thy cross I cling
Naked, come to Thee for dress
Helpless, look to Thee for grace
Vile, I to the fountain fly

Wash me, savior, or I die
Rock of ages, cleft for me
Let me hide myself in Thee
Rock of ages, cleft for me
Let me hide myself in Thee

All Things Bright And Beautiful
 

All things bright and beautiful
All creatures great and small
All things wise and wonderful
The Lord God made them all

Each little flower that opens
Each little bird that sings
He made their glowing colours
He made their tiny wings

All things bright and beautiful
All creatures great and small
All things wise and wonderful
The Lord God made them all

The purple-headed mountain
The river running by
The sunset and the morning
That brightens up the sky

All things bright and beautiful
All creatures great and small
All things wise and wonderful
The Lord God made them all

The cold wind in the winter
The pleasant summer sun
The ripe fruits in the garden
He made them every one

All things bright and beautiful
All creatures great and small
All things wise and wonderful
The Lord God made them all

The tall trees in the greenwood
The meadows for our play
The rushes by the water
To gather every day

All things bright and beautiful
All creatures great and small
All things wise and wonderful
The Lord God made them all

He gave us eyes to see them
And lips that we might tell
How great is God Almighty
Who has made all things well

All things bright and beautiful
All creatures great and small
All things wise and wonderful
The Lord God made them all...

Amazing Grace
 

[Verse 1]
Amazing Grace, how sweet the sound,
That saved a wretch like me.
I once was lost but now am found,
Was blind, but now I see.

[Verse 2]
T'was Grace that taught my heart to fear.
And Grace, my fears relieved.
How precious did that Grace appear
The hour I first believed.

[Verse 3]
Through many dangers, toils and snares
I have already come;
'Tis Grace that brought me safe thus far
and Grace will lead me home.

[Verse 4]
The Lord has promised good to me.
His word my hope secures.
He will my shield and portion be,
As long as life endures.

[Verse 5]
Yea, when this flesh and heart shall fail,
And mortal life shall cease,
I shall possess within the veil,
A life of joy and peace.

[Verse 5]
When we've been there ten thousand years
Bright shining as the sun.
We've no less days to sing God's praise
Than when we've first begun.
